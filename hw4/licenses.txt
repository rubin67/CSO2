Licenses
GNU General Public License (GPL):
Summary: The GPL is a copyleft license that requires derivative works to be distributed under the same license. 

I decided not to use the GPL for my project because I wanted to allow for more permissive use of the code, including integration into proprietary software without imposing the requirement to open-source the entire product.


MIT License:
Summary: The MIT License is a permissive license that allows for almost unrestricted use, modification, distribution, and sublicense of the software.

I chose the MIT License for my project because it provides a balance between openness and simplicity, allowing users to freely use and modify the code while maintaining a clear copyright statement.


Apache License 2.0:
Summary: The Apache License 2.0 is a permissive license with some additional conditions, including a patent grant, a limitation of liability, and a requirement to include a copy of the license in derivative works.

While the Apache License 2.0 offers similar freedoms to the MIT License, its additional patent grant clause provides stronger protection for contributors and users. 
However, I ultimately opted for the MIT License due to its simplicity and widespread adoption in the open-source community.
